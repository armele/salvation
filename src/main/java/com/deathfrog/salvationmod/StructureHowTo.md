/give @s minecraft:structure_block

Use place one structure block just outside the structure to be saved.
Provide a name, and set it as a "save" block

Use a second structure block to mark the opposite corner.
Set it to corner mode and name it to match the first block.

On the "save" block, detect the structure, then save.

The structure being saved must include a jigsaw block. (/give @s minecraft:jigsaw)
The jigsaw block will be the effective placement point of the structure. For a structure with a "basement", you would then want your jigsaw box elevated from the bottom of the overall structure by the depth of the basement.
